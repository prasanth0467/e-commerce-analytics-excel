## <h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project delivers an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze sales revenue, customer contribution, delivery performance, and platform-level trends. The solution transforms raw transactional data into business-ready insights using Excel-based data cleaning, pivot modeling, calculated metrics, and dynamic visualizations.

The dashboard is designed for stakeholder-friendly decision-making with slicers, KPI cards, and performance visuals that update dynamically based on user selections.

## <h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Business teams often struggle to extract actionable insights from raw sales data due to:

* Lack of visibility into revenue drivers
* Difficulty identifying top customers and categories
* Limited understanding of delivery delays and service impact
* Manual reporting with static views
* Inability to slice performance across dimensions dynamically

This project addresses these challenges by building a centralized, interactive Excel dashboard that enables quick exploration of revenue, customers, platforms, and delivery metrics.
